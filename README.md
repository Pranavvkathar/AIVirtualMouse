# AIVirtualMouse
I created Project based on computer vision using Python language.
This project promotes an approach to human-computer interaction HCL. Where we use the real-time camera for controlling the mouse function. Our proposed project is on a hand gesture-based system that allows users to control desktop mouse movements using hand gestures. To detect hand gesture movements, our system makes use of a desktop webcam. The goal is to control mouse cursor functions with a simple camera or webcam rather than a traditional or standard device. Using only a camera, the Virtual Mouse provides an infrastructure between the user and the machine. It enables the user to interact with a machine without the need for any mechanical or physical devices and even allows to control mouse functions. The domain of the project is AI/ML.
The goal is to move the mouse pointer on the screen without using any hardware, such as a mouse, and instead by utilizing finger motions, i.e. the gesture recognition process. Different technologies have been explored in the development of virtual mice in recent years. Our project's suggested technology focuses on three main areas: object identification, picture processing, and color recognition. I demonstrate an innovative method of Human-Computer Interaction in this research, in which cursor movement is controlled by a real-time camera.

#Components:
The components used in this venture cannot be detailed, as this assignment is an example for all computer systems. So, for positive the requirements are as follows:
Hardware requirement:
1. Webcam
To get an image, a webcam is required. Mouse sensitivity is constant with digicam clarity. The excellent consumer information is demonstrated whilst the digicam configuration is high enough. The camera is used for real-time images at any time the pc is on. The system will pick out the suitable movement
primarily based on contact and finger movement.
Software Requirement
1. OpenCV
OpenCV is a massive open-source library of computer imagination and prescient, machine mastering, and picture processing and now performs a primary function. in real-time performance is the maximum important in current systems. with the aid of the usage of it, one could system images and motion pictures to peer matters, faces, or even human handwriting.
2. Media Pipe:
MediaPipe is an open-source cross-platform framework developed by Google that enables the building of real-time applications for various multimedia processing tasks. It provides a set of pre-built components and tools for processing and analyzing video, audio, and sensor data. MediaPipe focuses on enabling efficient, flexible, and scalable multimedia processing pipelines.
3. pyautogui

PyAutoGUI is a Python library that provides cross-platform support for automating mouse and keyboard interactions. It allows you to programmatically control the mouse and keyboard, simulate mouse movements and clicks, and automate repetitive tasks on your computer. PyAutoGUI is designed to be simple, easy to use, and platform-independent.
Key features and functionalities of PyAutoGUI include:
Mouse Control: PyAutoGUI enables you to move the mouse cursor, click, double-click, and scroll the mouse wheel programmatically. You can also retrieve the current position of the mouse cursor and check for the presence of certain colors or images on the screen
